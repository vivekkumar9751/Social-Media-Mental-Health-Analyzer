# Social Media Mental Health Analyzer

## Overview
This project analyzes mental health trends and sentiment in social media posts (Twitter/Reddit) to identify signals of depression, anxiety, and overall emotional well-being in the online population. It uses natural language processing (NLP), sentiment analysis, and topic modeling to uncover patterns, visualize trends, and potentially provide early-warning alerts.

## Features
- Automated data collection from Twitter and Reddit APIs based on keywords/hashtags
- Data cleaning and preprocessing pipeline
- Advanced sentiment analysis (using VADER/TextBlob/BERT)
- Topic modeling to identify core mental health themes
- Time-series trends and seasonal pattern detection
- Interactive dashboard for data exploration and visualization
- (Optional) Geospatial mapping of sentiment trends

## About the Problem
Mental health issues are a global concern, and social media often reflects real-time mood shifts in the population. By analyzing this data, we can gain insights into collective emotional health and potentially assist in early intervention.

## Tech Stack
- **Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Streamlit (or Dash), SQL/MongoDB
- **APIs:** Twitter, Reddit
- **Deployment:** Streamlit Cloud or Heroku

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository
2. Install requirements:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Obtain API keys for Twitter/Reddit and set up configs
4. Run `main.py` or the provided Jupyter notebook
5. Launch the dashboard:  
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
6. Explore visualizations and insights
